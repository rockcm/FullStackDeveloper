Project Description: Skin Management System

Overview: The Skin Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the management of in-game skins for a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) environment. The system is built using the FastAPI framework, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and seamless integration with the underlying data structures.

Key Features:

Skin Listing and Retrieval:

Endpoint: /skins/ Functionality: Retrieves a list of all available CS:GO skins, providing detailed information such as Name, Description, WeaponName, RarityName, and PictureUrl. This endpoint serves as the foundation for skin exploration within the system.

Skin Details by ID:

Endpoint: /skins/{skin_id} Functionality: Fetches detailed information about a specific CS:GO skin identified by its unique ID. This facilitates precise retrieval of skin details, enabling users to access specific skins based on their unique identifiers.

Skin Creation:

Endpoint: /skins/ Functionality: Allows the addition of new CS:GO skins to the system. Users can submit details such as Name, Description, WeaponName, RarityName, and PictureUrl, enriching the collection of available in-game skins.

Skin Deletion:

Endpoint: /skins/{skin_id} Functionality: Permits the removal of CS:GO skins from the system based on their unique IDs. This ensures the ability to manage and curate the collection of available skins.

Skin Update:

Endpoint: /skins/{skin_id} Functionality: Supports the modification of existing CS:GO skin details. Users can update information such as Name, Description, WeaponName, RarityName, and PictureUrl for a specific skin. User-Added

Skin Listing:

Endpoint: /user-skins/ Functionality: Retrieves a list of CS:GO skins added by users. This includes skins submitted by players, enriching the system with personalized additions. User-Added

Skin Addition:

Endpoint: /user-skins/ Functionality: Enables users to contribute their own CS:GO skins to the system. Users can submit details similar to the standard skin creation process, contributing to the diversity of available skins.

User-Added Skin Deletion:

Endpoint: /user-skins/{skin_id} Functionality: Allows users to remove their previously added CS:GO skins from the system. This ensures users have control over the content they've contributed. User-Added

Skin Update:

Endpoint: /user-skins/{skin_id} Functionality: Supports the modification of details for user-added CS:GO skins. Users can update information such as Name, Description, WeaponName, RarityName, and PictureUrl for their submitted skins. Usage: The Skin Management System serves as a central hub for CS:GO skin administration, offering a user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, updating, and removing both standard and user-added skins. The implementation follows best practices, ensuring code integrity and system reliability.

Technologies:

FastAPI for backend development. CSV files for data storage. Python for server-side logic. Blazor for front end interface. Conclusion: The Skin Management System provides a robust and extensible solution for managing CS:GO skins, catering to both standard and user-contributed content. Its clear and well-defined endpoints facilitate seamless integration with other systems and pave the way for future enhancements.
